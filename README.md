# About me
## My Interests 
#### I am pursuing my Associates in Business Analytics with plans to get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I enjoy running, hiking, camping with my family, and exploring new places in the outdoors. GitHub has been something I've been excited to use for a while and happy to finally be using it. 

## Websites I Recommend 
- [DataCamp] https://www.datacamp.com/ - I find DataCamp to be a great website because it has lessons on all of the major programming languages, as well as BI tools and excel. It it as great website to keep your skills fresh and see how the industry is using these tools.

- [W3schools] https://www.w3schools.com/ - I would recommend W3schools for the help this website provides on all of the major programming and web development languages out there. The website also offers introduction tutorials to see how the syntax is used for these languages.
